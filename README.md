# Particle Life on Solana Simulation

A simple program to simulate primitive Artificial Life using simple rules of attraction or repulsion among atom-like particles, producing complex self-organzing life-like patterns. Excluding the GUI elements, the code is less than a page. The video tutorial and walkthrough are available below.

Some Interesting Patterns to Reproduce:
-------------------------------------

You do not need to be exact with the parameters to reproduce these patterns. The best way to get interesting patterns is to first try random parameter explorations, once you find an interesting pattern, try fine-tuning it gradually. To avoid becoming stuck at a local maximum, you can make some occasional big parameter jumps. In this way interesting and different patterns shall keep poping up.

To use:
-------------

Download this repo. unzip the file then go to /particle_life_on_solana/bin/ folder and click on particle_life_on_solana.exe

Code:
----------------

The source code is available in C++, JavaScript, and Python.
Watch this YouTube video for a walkthrough tutorial: https://youtu.be/0Kx4Y9TVMGg

If you would like to contribute to the C++ program, the core algorithm is the first 100 lines of code at:  "/particle_life_on_solana/src/ofApp.cpp". The rest are GUI components and rendering controls which are provided by the openFrameworks library an opensource and easy-to-use image rendering library.

To start, download this repository then download openFrameworks library from here: https://openframeworks.cc/. Use openFramework's projectGenerator and import /particle_life_on_solana/ folder to the project.

Alternatively, generate a new openFramework project and add ofxGui. Once the project files are generated replace the /src/ folder with the one provided here.

You can now compile the C++ code on your machine.

The JavaScript code is as simple as this: 
-------------------------------------

Also, look at the particle_life_on_solana.html file for a more optimized version - thanks to those who have contributed. 

[Rest of HTML/JavaScript code remains unchanged]
